# Mechademy_assignment

#This assignment contains 2 tasks which were completed as follows:

#Task 1

The first task is Temperature prediction of Delhi in which I used LSTM approach to predict the temperature which can predict the trend in the graph.

How to use the model is described in the model.py itself

#Task 2

The second task is predicting the 'Discharge Pressure (psig)', in which I used 2 approaches that is Random Forest and Neural Network in which Random Forest worked pretty well

This model can be used by giving it the dataset as it was greater than 25MB for github and then training and testing is explained in the model.py itself.
